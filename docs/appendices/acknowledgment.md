# Acknowledgment

[Luca Tumedei](https://github.com/lucatume) wrote the **Content Importer** classes. This is can be activated in the admin dashboard and is helpful if you want to create translations of starting from a copy of a post. 

The **flags** are already included in the compressed file. In a sub folder are .PNG format icons made by [Mark James](http://famfamfam.com/) whom I thank for his super work!

In addition I would like to 
thank [Jürgen Mayer](http://blog.jrmayer.co/) for creating the plugin's 
**banner**.

Last but not least I'd like to thank [Françoise Lhermitte](http://www.ajwan.net) for his **help with the translation** into English.
